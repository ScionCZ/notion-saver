Privacy Policy — Notion Saver Extension
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

This Privacy Policy explains how the Notion Saver Extension (“we”, “us”, “the Extension”) collects, uses and shares information.

Information we collect: We only store the minimal data required to use the Notion API on your behalf — specifically an OAuth access token and the Notion database ID you choose. We do not collect personal data from your browser beyond this, and we do not transmit or store your browser history, passwords, or other personal files.

How we use it: The access token is used only to create pages in your chosen Notion database when you click “Save”. Tokens are stored locally in your browser storage.

Sharing: We do not share your token or data with third parties.

Security: Tokens are stored in the browser’s extension storage. Treat your token as sensitive: revoke it in Notion settings if you suspect misuse.
